\title{Evaluate Consensus vs. GOseq Enrichment}
\usage{
evaluate_consensus_vs_goseq(
  consensus_file,
  goseq_file,
  output_dir,
  network_dir = file.path(dirname(dirname(normalizePath(consensus_file, winslash = "/",
    mustWork = FALSE))), "Network_analysis")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{consensus_file}{Path to consensus enrichment Excel file.}

\item{goseq_file}{Path to GOseq enrichment results CSV.}

\item{output_dir}{Directory to store evaluation outputs
(recommended canonical: "<run>/evaluation"; legacy accepted).}

\item{network_dir}{Directory where network outputs live. If omitted, this function
prefers "<run>/networks" (canonical) and falls back to "<run>/Network_analysis" (legacy).}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns NULL; writes plots and tables to `output_dir`.
}
\description{
Compares EchoGO consensus enrichment results against GOseq-only enrichment
using multiple complementary metrics:
\itemize{
  \item Jaccard Index for term overlap (overall, per ontology, by depth)
  \item Enrichment Quality Index (EQI) distributions and summary statistics
  \item Fold Enrichment distributions
  \item Term origin distributions
  \item Rarefaction curves showing recovery of new terms from multi-species integration
  \item Network complexity comparison between strict (True Consensus) and exploratory modes
}
Generates Venn diagrams, density plots, cumulative and permutation rarefaction curves,
and summary tables. Designed to mirror the functionality and output structure of the
corresponding .Rmd analysis step in the EchoGO workflow.
