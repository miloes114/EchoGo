Description: EchoGO is a modular framework for functional enrichment analysis 
    in non-model organisms. It integrates bias-aware GOseq enrichment with 
    orthology-based g:Profiler enrichment across multiple species, builds 
    consensus scores, performs semantic similarity reduction with RRvGO, and 
    generates curated visual outputs including lollipop plots, rarefaction 
    curves, enrichment networks, and HTML reports. It is especially suited 
    for transcriptomic studies with de novo assemblies or sparse annotations.
