Description: EchoGO is a modular framework for functional enrichment analysis
    in non-model organisms. It integrates bias-aware GOseq enrichment with
    orthology-based g:Profiler enrichment across multiple species, builds
    consensus scores, performs semantic similarity reduction with RRvGO, and
    generates curated visual outputs including lollipop plots, rarefaction
    curves, enrichment networks, and HTML reports. It is especially suited
    for transcriptomic studies with de novo assemblies or sparse annotations.
